# Product Requirements Document (PRD): HyperSPEED Telegram Bot

## 1. Overview
### 1.1 Purpose
The HyperSPEED Telegram Bot is a Telegram-based tool integrated with the HyperSPEED protocol on Hyperliquid EVM (HyperEVM). It enables users to snipe new token launches, interact with DeFi projects, and launch their own tokens using the SPEED token as the base liquidity asset. Built for speed enthusiasts and crypto traders, the bot leverages HyperEVM’s sub-second finality to provide a fast, accessible DeFi experience, bridging a massive social audience to the ecosystem.

### 1.2 Goals
- Enable instant token sniping and trading on HyperEVM.
- Simplify token launch processes via Telegram commands.
- Drive adoption of the SPEED token in liquidity pools.
- Onboard car-and-bike fans from social media into DeFi.

### 1.3 Target Audience
- Crypto traders and DeFi enthusiasts.
- Token creators seeking easy launch platforms.

## 2. Features
### 2.1 Core Features
- **Token Sniping**  
  - Allow users to snipe newly launched tokens on HyperSPEED with real-time alerts and auto-buy functionality.
  - Leverage HyperEVM’s speed for sub-second transaction execution.
- **DeFi Interactions**  
  - Support basic DeFi actions: trade, stake, or farm across Hyperliquid projects.
  - Provide wallet balance checks and transaction history.
- **Token Launch Support**  
  - Enable users to launch tokens via Telegram commands (e.g., set pre-sale, deploy contract, seed SPEED liquidity pools).
  - Integrate with HyperSPEED smart contracts for seamless deployment.

### 2.2 Secondary Features
- **Notifications**  
  - Send alerts for new token launches, pre-sale openings, and pool updates.
- **User Management**  
  - Allow wallet linking and authentication via Telegram.
- **Analytics**  
  - Display basic stats (e.g., token price, pool depth) for sniped or launched tokens.

### 2.3 Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance**: Handle 1,000+ concurrent users with <1s response time.
- **Security**: Implement wallet signature verification and protect against front-running.
- **Scalability**: Support growth as HyperEVM adoption increases.

## 3. User Stories
### 3.1 Trader
- **As a trader**, I want to snipe new tokens instantly, so I can capitalize on early price movements.
  - Acceptance Criteria: Bot sends alerts within 5s of a launch; auto-buy executes in <2s.
- **As a trader**, I want to check my SPEED balance, so I can plan my next trade.
  - Acceptance Criteria: Balance displayed with a `/balance` command in <3s.

### 3.2 Token Creator
- **As a token creator**, I want to launch a token via Telegram, so I can reach users quickly.
  - Acceptance Criteria: Launch process completes with `/launch <token_name> <supply>` in <10s; SPEED pool seeded automatically.
- **As a token creator**, I want to set a pre-sale, so I can raise funds efficiently.
  - Acceptance Criteria: Pre-sale config (e.g., price, cap) set with `/presale <details>`; funds locked in contract.

### 3.3 Community Member
- **As a community member**, I want launch notifications, so I can stay updated on HyperSPEED activity.
  - Acceptance Criteria: Notifications sent for all launches and pre-sales to subscribed users.

## 4. Technical Requirements
### 4.1 Architecture
- **Platform**: Telegram Bot API with Node.js or Python backend.
- **Blockchain Integration**: Connect to HyperEVM via Web3.js or Ethers.js; interact with HyperSPEED smart contracts (e.g., `LaunchPad.sol`, `LiquidityPool.sol`).
- **Database**: SQLite or MongoDB for user data and transaction logs.
- **Security**: Use HMAC-SHA256 for API authentication; encrypt wallet data.

### 4.2 APIs
- **Telegram API**: Handle commands (e.g., `/snipe`, `/launch`) and send messages.
- **HyperEVM RPC**: Query blockchain state and submit transactions.
- **HyperSPEED Contract ABI**: Interface with deployed contracts for launches and pools.

### 4.3 Dependencies
- `@openzeppelin/contracts` for ERC-20 (SPEED token).
- `telegraf` or `python-telegram-bot` for Telegram integration.
- `web3.js` or `ethers.js` for HyperEVM interaction.

### 4.4 Constraints
- Must support HyperEVM gas limits and token standards.
- Initial deployment on HyperEVM testnet, then mainnet.

## 5. Risks and Mitigations
- **Risk**: Front-running on snipes.  
  - Mitigation: Use private mempool or randomized transaction submission.
- **Risk**: Bot overload during launches.  
  - Mitigation: Implement rate limiting and queue system.
